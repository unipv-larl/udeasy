# About udeasy

There are many tools designed for working with treebanks and websites
that allow to query [Universal Dependecy](https://universaldependencies.org/) treebanks online.

But there are some issues that a user may encounter using these tools:
* the online tools only allow to query treebanks that already are in UD
* the tools for processing treebanks are designed to be used from a
command line interface or included in a script
* they force the user to learn a query language

Udeasy is designed to overcome all these issues:
* it allows to query CoNLL-U treebanks that are not in Universal
Dependencies, such as [SUD](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/) treebanks or treebanks created by the
user. They still need to be in the [CoNLL-U format](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
* it has a graphic interface that guides the user step by step in the
design of the query
* there is no need to learn any query language

udeasy is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux distributions (see the [download page](download.md)).
