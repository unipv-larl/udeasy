# udeasy

Udeasy is an application written in Python 3 whose main goal is to allow
the user to easily query a treebank and extract patterns from a treebank in
CoNLL-U format.
The functions to extract the occurrences from a treebank rely on the udapi
Python package. The graphic interface is built using the GUI toolkit
wxPython.
